# Movie Ratings Analysis

This project aims to analyze and visualize movie ratings to uncover patterns in viewer preferences, the influence of release years on ratings, and any correlations between genres and average ratings. By using data visualization tools in Python, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly, you can generate insights that illustrate these relationships clearly and intuitively.
